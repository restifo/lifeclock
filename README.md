# Lifeclock

A simple Arduino sketch for marking time on a WS2812b led (Neopixel for Adafruit). This
starts with green and then proceeds to yellow, red, and then flashing red. Pushing a button
will reset the timer.

You can use this to help you remind to do something over time, such as watering your plants.
